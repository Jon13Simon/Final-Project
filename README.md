# Comparison-of-CNN-Architectures-on-Different-Datasets

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of different CNN architectures on various datasets. Specifically, we will evaluate LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, ResNet, Xception, and SENet on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. The comparison will be based on metrics such as loss curves, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Approach
1. Load and preprocess the datasets (MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10).
2. Implement the following CNN architectures: LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, ResNet, Xception, and SENet.
3. Train each model on each dataset, recording the loss and accuracy metrics.
4. Evaluate the performance of each model on the test sets using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Plot the loss curves and other performance metrics for comparison.
6. Analyze the results to understand the impact of different architectures and datasets on model performance.

## The datasets used in this project are:

MNIST: Handwritten digits dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

FMNIST: Fashion MNIST dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of fashion products. Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

CIFAR-10: Dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Data Set Explanation

The datasets are chosen to cover a variety of image classification tasks:

MNIST and FMNIST provide simpler tasks with grayscale images, allowing for the evaluation of basic image recognition capabilities.
CIFAR-10 offers a more complex task with color images, testing the models â€™abilities to handle more detailed and varied data.
